## Inspiration

Applying for jobs can be a difficult process, having to tailor your CV for many different positions can be cumbersome at best. So what if there was a way that you can make your CV dynamic so all you have to do is choose? What projects do I think they will like the most? Just pick them. What work experience is the most relevant? Add those too. Do I think they will appreciate only 2 project and 2 work experiences or should I do 3 to 1 instead? Toggle what you want on and off and then print the version.
